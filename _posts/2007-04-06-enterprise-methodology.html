<h3>How to inforce an enterprise-wide methodology?</h3>
</header>
<section>
A financial company wants to adopt a global methodology to better master the requirement and design phases of its projects, and to create a manageable enterprise memory. After several studies, the end-up solution is composed of internal best practices in different fields, of RUP and UML methodologies, and of a complex set of products and tools.  <br/><br/> 
Which tactic has been used to spread the enterprise-wide methodology? <br/><br/>
For budget reasons, external staff, that represents more than 2 on 3 persons working for this company, receive no more allocated material. Each external person will work on their on personal computer. <br/><br/>
Internal IT services refuses to install any tool or product on the external staff pc, argumenting that their service scope is only for internals. <br/><br/>
After two years of a such experiment, the dissemination within the company is always in phase of initialization. No progress has been seen, and the enterprise-wide methodology is not applied at all, each intervening people uses its own methodology. <br/><br/>Dismaying, isn't it!
