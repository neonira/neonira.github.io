Offensive programming ecosystem has been upgraded. You may now use new versions of packages according to following table

package name (available on CRAN)| recommanded version 
:------------------------------|:------------------
[wyz.code.offensiveProgramming](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wyz.code.offensiveProgramming) | 1.1.17 or higher
[wyz.code.testthat](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wyz.code.testthat) | 1.1.16 or higher
[wyz.code.metaTesting](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wyz.code.metaTesting) | 1.1.11 or higher
[wyz.code.rdoc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=wyz.code.rdoc) | 1.1.15 or higher

New functionnalities
====================

Global support of _environment_, _S3_, _S4_, _RC_ and _R6_ objects enhanced and strengthened. Offensive programming instrumentation is available for your favorite **R** class flavor. 

Package **wyz.code.rdoc** allows you to create **R** manual pages in a programmatic way, thus allowing greater reuse of documentation pieces from one manual page to another. 

Moreover, you can now also use it with standard **R** functions. Offensive programming instrumentation is no more a required precondition to generate mannual pages with package **wyz.code.rdoc**.

Scope of supported manual pages for generation is now complete: data, function, objects/classes and package manual pages can be generated in a programmatic way. 

Main enhancements
=================
You have

1.  higher usability: more intuitive and friendly functions
1.  increased robustness: more than 400 tests added
1.  improved documentation: both manual pages (made using wyz.code.rdoc) and vignettes have been rewritten
1.  increased code coverage: a global score higher than 99%.


Feel free to download directly from CRAN for trial, experimentation or for professional use.
