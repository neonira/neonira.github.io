2018 FIFA World cup football is reaching end of pool phase. It is now time, to revisit, previous blog post on this topic, and to analyze results of the 8 groups.  


## Results    

Let's review each group and analyze how it fits with provided diagrams of [previous post](fifa_1)
### group A 
<table>
<thead>
   <tr>
      <th>Team</th><th>Games played</th><th>Victories</th><th>Ties</th><th>Defeats</th><th>Goals scored</th><th>goals conceded</th><th>goal difference</th><th>points</th>
   </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
   <tr><td>Uruguay</td>     <td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>5</td> <td>9</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Russia</td>      <td>3</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>4</td> <td>6</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Saudi Arabia</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>-5</td><td>3</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Egypt</td>       <td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>-4</td><td>0</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Very simple group, from a result point of view. No tie, one great leader, that is Uruguay, won all its games. One second leader, that won all its games except one. Refer to first diagram of [previous post](fifa_1#notie) and you'll see that it is the most extreme case on far left of the diagram without any tie. 

### group B
<table>
<thead>
   <tr>
      <th>Team</th><th>Games played</th><th>Victories</th><th>Ties</th><th>Defeats</th><th>Goals scored</th><th>goals conceded</th><th>goal difference</th><th>points</th>
   </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
   <tr><td>Spain</td>   <td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>1</td> <td>5</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Portugal</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1</td> <td>5</td></tr>
   <tr><td>IR Iran </td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td> <td>4</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Morroco</td> <td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Much more complex group, much disputed, and a final tie on first place between Spain and Portugal. Refer to first tie diagram of [previous post](fifa_1#tie1) to consider result. Untie between the two team is given by the rules [Official document](https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/2018-fifa-world-cup-russiatm-regulations-2843519.pdf?cloudid=ejmfg94ac7hypl9zmsys). Look at [page 26](https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/2018-fifa-world-cup-russiatm-regulations-2843519.pdf?cloudid=ejmfg94ac7hypl9zmsys#page=28) to get the decision rules allowing to break the ties at the end of the group matches. Here, decision is taken on number of goals scored that is the c) condition considered, that allows to differentiate Spain from Portugal.

### group C

   <tr><td>Danemark</td> <td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td> <td>5</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Peru</td>     <td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td> <td>3</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Australia</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>-3</td><td>1</td></tr>
