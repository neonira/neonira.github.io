One frequently asked question, and very often left open is “What should
I reuse?” and its corollary “What reusable items categorization should I
consider?”.

Generally, each of us had its own idea about this topic, and it ends up
not to be so easy to get to a shared view about reuse and reusable items.

# My way

I faced that issue many times, and it is time to share my best practice
about it. I created a one-slide summary for reusable items, that will
help you consider the problem and solve it. See here under.
