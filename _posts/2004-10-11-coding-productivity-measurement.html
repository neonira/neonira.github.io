<h3>How to measure coding productivity?</h3>

You are a project director in the public services domain. The
	initial project time frame is 14 months. Your
	budget is short and you are asked to provide productivity metrics
	for each member of your development team. 
</header>
<section>
<h3>Which metrics do you select? </h3>
	On this project, the director decided that the selected metric will
	be the number of line of <cite class="kw">C</cite> code produced per day, and per developer.

	<h3>Can you figure out what happened? </h3>

	After one month of development, the metric showed a great
	variation from one developer to another. Once published, the
	metrics have triggered a poor-productivity developer
	hunt, ended by the dismissal of three developers. <br/><br/>

	Remaining developers were asked to increase their productivity
	according to a monthly given goal. Each month, poor-productivity developers have to explain their results in front of a dedicated bureau of investigation.

        <h3>At the end of the 11th month</h3>
	The status was
	<ul>
	<li>Productivity metrics were always reached.</li>
	<li>Project director and enterprise management were proud of
	the results. The project lead is proven to be
	"under control".</li>
	</ul> 	
</section>
<section>	
	<h3>At the end of the 14th month</h3>
        The status was
	<ul>
	<li>Productivity metrics were still reached.</li>
	<li>Project management was still satisfied.</li>
	<li> Average developer turnover time on the project was 4
	months. </li>
	<li> Project has been delayed because of the incapacity to run
	the user acceptance test.</li>
	</ul> 
</section>
<section>
	<h3>At the end of the 19th month</h3>
        The status was
	<ul>
	<li>Productivity metrics were still reached.</li>
	<li>Project management was very dissatisfied.</li>
	<li> No developer accepts to work for this project. </li>
	<li> Project is stuck, and still unable to run the user
	acceptance test.</li>
	</ul> 
</section>

	<h3>At the end of the 23th month</h3>
        The project has been killed, by
	an external audit, about code quality. Here are some excerpts
	of the audit report, translated from French to English
	<ul>
	<li>The volume of produced C code is gigantic [...] more than
        400 000 files [...] The smallest project include header has a
        size of 34Kb [...] The largest has a size of 453Kb [...] </li>
	<li>The number of C function, with a code volume exceeding 10
        000 lines of code before processing is about 80. </li>
	<li>We guess that developer skills were insufficient for
	this type of project [...] In particular, we do not understand why
	there is so few usage of programming language loop constructs, like
	<cite class="code">for</cite> or <cite
	class="code">while</cite>. [ ... ] Some code parts are weird.
	For example, on file <pre>consmgt.c</pre>, the same instruction <code>i++;</code> is
	reproduced continuously on 512 lines.   </li>
	<li>We are surprised of the ratio between the written code
	volume, and the compiled code volume. That's clearly better than commonly
	accepted standard ratios. </li>
	<li> After code inspection, we can argue that maintenance will
	be really expensive, because of the lack of reuse between the
	different modules of the system [...]</li>
	<li> Project is  still unable to run the user acceptance test.</li>
	</ul>

	 <h3>After the 24th month</h3>
        An internal audit has showned
	<ul>
	<li> That the three fired developpers were the best of the
        team. Two of them have leaved the enterprise. </li>
	</ul>
