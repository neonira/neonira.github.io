<a href='http://tcec.chessdom.com/archive.php'>Chess engine championship TCEC</a> season 9, stage 3 terminated on first week of September 2016, and we can not
                                argue without surprise. <cite class='kw'>Stockfish</cite> had a powerfull lead, and <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite>, already 3 times winner of this championship, succeeded in qualifying for the final. One looser,
                                <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite>, current champion, faced strong opposition, apparently stronger thant supposed to be qualified.

                                Before entering <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> and <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite>, performance analysis, it is worth knowing that I am neither supporting one or the other, neither working for any of them. 
                                My goal is to provide and share here some of my analysis and materials to let you forge your own opinion. 

				<br/><br/>
				Just a context recall, TCEC season 9, stage 3 involved 8 chess engines, each of them had to face 8 times each opponent, thus leading to 224 showdowns beetween chess engines. During this stage, chess engines were granted rights to use same opening books up to a predefined plies depth, and also right to use table positions. You may read full rules documentation through TCEC hyperlink given above.

                                <h3> Which performs the best ? </h3>
					Day after day, while watching some chess games played during stage 3, it was clear that a kind of classification will appear amidst chess engine performance.
					If true, this should be visible from a simple stat table. Let's have a look to stage 3, chess engine performance comparison table,
					
					<div><img src='/images/games/a/comparePerformance.png' classs="alone" alt=''/> </div>
				       
					Three groups of chess engines seems to emerge
					<ol>
					<li>a group able to win more than 25% of their games, thus composed of <cite class='kw'>Stockfish</cite>, <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> and <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> </li>
					<li>a group able to draw more than 80% of their games, here only Fire is in the group</li>
					<li>a group unable to avoid loss less than 25%. Subgroups could be consider here, by a split on 5% win, thus leading to a first subgroup with <cite class='kw'>Andscacs</cite>, <cite class='kw'>Jonny</cite> and <cite class='kw'>Gull</cite>, and a second subgroup with <cite class='kw'>Rybka</cite>. </li>
					</ol>
                                        As <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> and <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> share the exact same draw performance, ability to win makes the difference. At this game, <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> has been slightly smarter than <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite>.

				<h3> Does the playing side make any difference in performance ? </h3>

					To ease analysis per engine, per side and per opening, I build following diagrams to sense performance difference. Use your Internet browser capabilities

					</div>
					When playing light side, both <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> and <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> either win or draw. On 28 games, <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> won 2 games more<cite class='comment'>13 vs 11</cite> than <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite>. 
                                        <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> performed better than <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> when playing light side during stage 3. 
                                        <div>
					
						 <img src='/images/games/a/Houdini-black.png' width='500px' alt=''/>
                                                 <img src='/images/games/a/Komodo-black.png' width='500px' alt=''/>  
					</div>
					When playing dark side, both engines recorded wins, draws and losses. On 28 games, <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> won 1 game less than <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> <cite class='comment'>4 vs 5</cite>, lost 1 game less <cite class='comment'>2 vs 3</cite>. Although different, results prove that engines reached same performance level when playing dark side.

				<h3> Any lesson's learnt ? </h3>
					Looking at openings played by <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> with black, it appears, that its 2 losses where under Sicilian game <cite class='comment'>56% of points loss</cite> far more than current loss registered by this engine during stage 3. Therefore, <cite class='kw'>Houdini</cite> opponents, should consider playing Sicilian opening willingly when playing light side. <br/><br/>
					For <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite>, 2 losses with black under Sicilian <cite class='comment'>40% of points taken</cite> and 1 under Catalan opening <cite class='comment'>only 25% points taken</cite>. So, <cite class='kw'>Komodo</cite> opponents should consider entering Catalan opening when playing light side. That's their best opportunity to score.
