Vendée globe started on November the 8th this year, and as provides 6
data vacations per day, to let you create your own diagrams. Here are
some, all based on official data provided by the [official
site](https://www.vendeeglobe.org/en/ranking).

I was willing to get a little bit more interesting diagrams and stats
than the one officially provided. Miss me are

1.  a diagram showing rank evolution by skipper
2.  a diagram showing distance to finish by skipper
3.  a diagram showing daily traveled distance
4.  a diagram showing daily boat speed

Rank evolution diagram
======================

Rank evolution results from abandons and skipper race strategy. Here
under a such diagram. Black flags are set on days where abandons
happened. One black flag whatever the number of abandon this day.

This diagram is much trickier to produce than it seems. I did not
succeed to produced it using <cite class="it">scale\_y\_reverse</cite>,
so I had to compute it.

Distance to finish diagram
==========================

Here a graph showing distance to finish for skipper Jérémie BEYOU,
currently last in the race, due to OFNI encounter. The skipper had to go
back to les Sables d’Olonne to repair the boat and then take again the
race with one full week late.

In purple, is the moving average computed using
<cite class="itb">zoo</cite> package <cite class="it">rollmean</cite>
function. Here, technically aligned at right, with a 12 values spans, as
this corresponds to 2 full days of race.

The main lesson is that sometimes the skippers prefer to sail away from
the direct route <cite class='comment'>in particular when too little
wind</cite>, even if it means straying from the goal.

Traveled distance diagram
=========================

The traveled distance is interesting as it shows the ability of the
skipper to go fast, and its capacity to read meteorological systems. A
sharper analysis allows to distinguish when the skipper is attacking or
safely calming down the pace.

Speed diagram
=============

This results from a montage done with two images, the first one
resulting from a <cite class="itb">ggplot2</cite> save, the second taken
from Vendée Globe image library.

For fun, meet the coolest skipper of the 2020 Vendée-Globe.
